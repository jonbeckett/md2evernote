# md2evernote

Recursively reads a directory containing markdown files, and uploads them to Evernote.

Designed to work with the output of wp2md (see https://github.com/jonbeckett/wp2md) - so you can take the contents of a Wordpress site, and upload to Evernote as plain text posts, back-dated to the original publishing dates (so, for example, the likes of postach.io will work correctly).

Also requires the Windows Evernote client installed.
